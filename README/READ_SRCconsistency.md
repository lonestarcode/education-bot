	1.	Verify consistency between:
	•	DTOs
	•	Models
	•	Services
	•	Controllers
	
    2.	Update database schema if needed.
	
    3.	Test CRUD endpoints


	Review integration points in 
   models, services, controllers, DTOs, to ensure consistency.



	Some generic models (StudentProfile, PersonalityProfile) might need better alignment with DTOs.
