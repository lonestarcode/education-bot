RECOMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT
	
    1.	Avoid Duplication in Configuration Files
	•	Ensure no duplicate or conflicting settings across config/ files. Cross-reference application.yml with global_defaults.yaml.
	
    2.	Centralize Constants and Shared Configurations
	•	Move reusable constants into a dedicated Constants.java class or central configuration file.
	
    3.	Refine models/ Directory
	•	Some generic models (StudentProfile, PersonalityProfile) might need better alignment with DTOs.
	
    4.	Review utils/ Directory
	•	Ensure utility methods (CommonUtils, ConfigUtils, ValidationUtils) are not redundant across services.
	
    5.	Monitoring and Metrics Integration
	•	Ensure data_pipeline/monitoring/ and monitoring/ don’t overlap responsibilities.
	
    6.	Consistent Documentation
	•	Double-check consistency in README files across all modules.
	
    7.	Global Configuration Check
	•	Verify config/global/third_party.yaml and config/global/api_gateway.yaml for consistency with integration points.
	
    8.	Frontend Integration
	•	Ensure frontend components align well with the backend endpoints.
